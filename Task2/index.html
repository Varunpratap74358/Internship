    <p>Using React, I can make this project even more dynamic and modular. By leveraging React's reusable components, I can break down the FAQs into smaller components such as Category, Question, and Answer. The state management in React makes it easy to handle the toggle feature for answers, and I can enhance the UI with animations or transitions using libraries like React Transition Group or Tailwind CSS utilities. Additionally, if I fetch the FAQs from an API or a JSON file, React's useEffect, fetch and axios methods can be used to display real-time dynamic data. These improvements will make your website not only responsive but also highly interactive and maintainable, which is ideal for long-term projects.</p>
